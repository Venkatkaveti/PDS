The data contains 8 different attributes gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, math score, reading score, writing score, 
The idea is to build a predictive model for given data and visualize  it 5 times. Before model building, data pre-processing is very important, on observing the data the dependent variable 

Stage 1: Consider every attribute and explain about them, including how are they measured and how it could affect the results, save all the explanation in a text file (Readme.txt). Also save the about table as a csv file 

Stage 2: There are no invalid, irrational, or missing values after visualization of data. Therefore, we can train a predictive model using raw data as input directly.

Stage 3: Now fit the data into multiple frailty detection models and analyze the results produced from those models.

the 5 different results screeshots were taken and saved in result folder
